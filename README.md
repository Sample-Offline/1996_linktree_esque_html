- [ ] Add 'FREE DOWNLOAD' large and in the user's face

- [ ] Get Chat Gem working
- [x] DNS to sampleoffline.com would be chill
- [ ] Format guestbook
- [ ] Format something-random
- [ ] Template engine (ejs?) for my own sanity when developing
- [ ] Add Dark Theme
- [x] Add logos for known music services
  - [ ] Change logos with the theme changing from light to dark
- [ ] It's a bg image OVER another bg image as the background, so when you scroll past the bottom it looks like you're "peeling it (the site) up"
